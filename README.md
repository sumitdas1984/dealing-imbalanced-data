# Click Through Rate Prediction

Imbalanced classes are a common problem in machine learning classification where there are a disproportionate ratio of observations in each class. Class imbalance can be found in many different areas including medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and fraud detection.

In this repository, weâ€™ll look at five possible ways to handle an imbalanced class problem.

## Data
We will use the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset available on Kaggle for this analysis. The general description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/methods-for-dealing-with-imbalanced-data).

I created this notebook for learning purposes and all credit's go to Tara Boyel and her [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/methods-for-dealing-with-imbalanced-data-5b761be45a18) and Will Badr and his [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/having-an-imbalanced-dataset-here-is-how-you-can-solve-it-1640568947eb)
