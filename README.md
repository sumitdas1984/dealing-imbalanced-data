# Click Through Rate Prediction

In Internet marketing, click-through rate (CTR) is a metric that measures the number of clicks advertisers receive on their ads per number of impressions.

In this repository we have done a research analysis based on the data provided by Criteo Labs. Criteo Labs is sharing 10 days’ worth of Avazu data for us to develop models predicting ad click-through rate (CTR). Given a user and the page he (or she) is visiting. what is the probability that he (or she) will click on a given ad? The goal of this analysis is to benchmark the most accurate ML algorithms for CTR estimation. Let’s get started!

## Data
The dataset can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data). The set should be downloaded and put into a foler named data in the repo.
